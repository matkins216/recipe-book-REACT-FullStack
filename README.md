## Recipe Book Overview:
- - -
Users on Recipe Book will be able to upload a photo of their recipe and give step-by-step instructions and ingredients for their recipe! As long as users separate their steps and ingredients by commas, it will be formatted in a way that is easy to read in each post. A user can like other user's recipes and view their profiles full of recipes.

 In the future I would like to:
   1. Save recipes from other Users to a personal recipe book
   2. Have recipes that are private and can't be viewed publicly
   3. Edit recipes
   4. Delete recipes
   5. Share recipe
